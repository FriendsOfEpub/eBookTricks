It is currently in v.0.33 (in other words, it’s a Minimum Viable Product) and available [on this page](https://friendsofepub.github.io/eBookTricks/).

## Details

This web app is just a glorified list of CSS snippets.

### What LGPL3 actually implies

You can fork this repo and make your own collection/web app. You can use it in commercial projets but your modifications to this specific part (consider this a library) should then be released with a LGPL3 license. Attribution is needed in any case.

### Why LGPL3 OMG it’s not MIT like the Blitz Framework!

The eBook dev ecosystem is a nightmare, we need eBook tools. And fast!

Very few people actually release those tools. Now it’s just a checklist so why would you want to keep this closed source, huh?
