The Blitz project is under an “End of Life process”, which means only critical bugs and security issues will still be addressed.

Maintenance for critical bugs will end on June, 15th.

Maintenance for security issues will end on September, 1st.

If your issue is not critical or is a feature request, please reconsider opening it as it will be locked for conversation and labeled `wontfix`. Thanks for your understanding.

Please check [the related Blitz issue](https://github.com/FriendsOfEpub/Blitz/issues/66) for more details.
